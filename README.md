Last changes 5/17 12:21 am

### Finished Part 3.
- downloaded JSON from Site using Alamofire
- store JSON file to local storage using Core Data
- use local storage offline (Even if url is incorrect or doesn't connect, the app will load the default stored quizzes from local storage)
- refreshes on Settings (haven't tested due to not having a similar JSON file in that format)

### Changes for the future
1. Need to fix UI for future use
2. Need to clean up code 
3. Need to comment code
